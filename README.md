## Challenge Description
### Background
> Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.
***from the UNC Bootcamp instructions for this challenge***

## Deliverables
This challenge consists of two parts. Use resource file data to create a __Jupyter notebook__ to calculate the precipitation and temperature in Hawaii within a given date range. Then use the data from that Jupyter notebook to create __Flask app__ to output those statistics as JSON style webpages.



### Part-1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data







### Part-2: Design Your Climate App
